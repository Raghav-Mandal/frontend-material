I am working on a Next.js (App Router) + Prisma + PostgreSQL project. Below are my Prisma models and example data. Based on these models, give me a recommended frontendÂ  file/folder structure including:

* Components
* App route folders (e.g., /courses/\[courseId])
* Hooks if needed
* Utility folder if required
* Shared types/interfaces
* State management if needed

Also consider that I am using:

* Clerk for auth
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn ui
* React Query (@tanstack/react-query)
* Dark/light mode toggle is already available in the navbar
* I may support mobile responsiveness later

Below are my Prisma models and sample data:

```prisma
