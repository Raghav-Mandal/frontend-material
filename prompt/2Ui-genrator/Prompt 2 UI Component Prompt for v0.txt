Prompt 2: UI Component Prompt for v0.dev (Page Structure-Based)
I will describe a UI layout or page structure for a given feature (e.g., a Course Details Page with chapters, definition, formula, and a Start Quiz button). Based on that, generate a prompt that I can paste into https://v0.dev to get the required component with:

Proper sectioning using TailwindCSS

Dark/light theme support

A desktop-first layout that gracefully degrades to mobile

Placeholders for dynamic data (like course title, chapter list, quiz button)

Responsive design patterns (2-column desktop â†’ stacked mobile)

Use only relevant fields; do not invent fields that aren't described

Make sure the prompt excludes unnecessary fields and adds transitions or animations for visual polish (like hover/scroll/fade effects if mentioned).
