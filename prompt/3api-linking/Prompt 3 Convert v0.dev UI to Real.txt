Prompt 3: Convert v0.dev UI to Real Component (Dynamic + Typed)
I will provide you with the static UI component code generated from https://v0.dev. You must:

Refactor it into a dynamic component:

Replace all dummy/static data with props

Accept props that match the fields from backend models I will give you

Keep the same UI and classNames â€” no design changes

Add typing support using TypeScript and model types

Ensure API fetch integration:

Accept the data as props if rendered server-side

Or fetch with React Query if client-side

Remove any unnecessary functionality or fields that were added by v0.dev but not present in the actual model

Ensure theme compatibility (dark/light mode) and preserve any animations or hover effects that were included

Output only the cleaned and optimized React component file (e.g., CourseDetails.tsx) and list any required packages if needed (like framer-motion, clsx, react-query, etc.).
