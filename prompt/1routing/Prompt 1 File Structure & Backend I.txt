 Prompt 1: File Structure & Backend Integration (Based on Models)
I will give you all the backend models (like User, Course, Chapter, Quiz, etc.) including their fields and relationships. Based on this, generate a complete frontend project folder structure using Next.js App Router, Clerk authentication (if present), Prisma ORM, and TailwindCSS (with ShadCN UI). Include the necessary structure for:

API routes (/api)

Components

Pages (using App Router)

UI for fetching and displaying model data

Folder structure for modular and scalable project organization.

I am using Clerk for authentication and Prisma with PostgreSQL. My backend includes the following models:


{


data model paste here 



}


Keep the file names clear and consistent. Assume React Query is used for fetching data, and the app supports dark mode with a global theme provider. Only output the folder and file structure â€” not the code content.
